  <h6>What is this?</h6>

  <p>An easy method to test your own CSS on standard HTML elements. Test some styles for an existing site. Make some boilerplate to kick off a project! <a href="https://github.com/opattison/Pattern-Primer-Jekyll">Fork or clone this repo for Jekyll on GitHub</a> if you want to try it out yourself with different styles or additional HTML elements or patterns.</p>

  <h6>Why a Jekyll fork?</h6>

  <p>Why not? I wanted to implement the a version of <a href="https://github.com/adactio/Pattern-Primer">Pattern-Primer</a> for my Jekyll projects with only Jekyll dependencies (and no PHP dependencies). It can be <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/">built locally with a Jekyll/Ruby environment</a> or uploaded as a static directory on a remote server.</p>

  <h6>Credits</h6>
  <p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Get Jekyll</a>, a brilliant static site generator which this was built with. If anything, this site proves that you can build things other than hacker blogs with Jekyll.</p>
  <p>The <strong>original</strong> Pattern Primer is by adactio (<a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a>) and can be <a href="https://github.com/adactio/Pattern-Primer">forked/cloned on GitHub</a> if you prefer PHP or aren't already using Jekyll. Many thanks to Jeremy for this great tool!</p>

  <p>Pattern samples follow.</p>
